# Vector_Work

  The respository features a series of codes that practically mimicks the functions needed to produce vectors. Instead of Vectors, the code uses dynamic arrays to replicate the way a vector works, including commands such as 'vector.pushback' that is uses to place an element
at the end of a vector's series of elements. The only used libraries are iostream and fstream, meaning the vector library isn't used at all.

The file 'Vector.h' includes the class, variable, and function definitions.
The file 'Vector.cpp' includes the full functions.
The file 'main.cpp' includes the user inputs and executable outputs.
